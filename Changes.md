    "Compile using vendor files" by yuya-takeyama
    Currently ./scripts/compile.sh and ./tests/bootstrap.php loads implicit dependencies from external repos.
    Now Onion has bundle feature, so they should load from ./vendor/pear explicitly.
    This change improves development portability, and easy to build continuously at external environment (for example Travis CI).

0.0.7
    - Use improved GetOptionKit and CLIFramework.
    - Added compile command.
